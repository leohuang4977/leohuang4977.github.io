I'm a psychologist who is equally interested in tech world. My research interests intersect human behaviors, consciousness, and AI.
 
My academic journey started with a B.S. in kinesiology at Queen’s University learning all about the human body. Then I focused in on the brain during my M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Toronto.  I’ve been a researcher at the Strokes Lab at John Hopkins advised by Prof. Wang Jian, McIntosh Lab with Prof. Randy McIntosh, and the Decision Neuroscience Lab with Prof. Cendri Hutcherson. I also love exploring longitudinal human datasets, exploring patterns and difference between people, and bringing insights to life through visualizations.

Outside of running surveys and tech projects, can find me on the golf course, fishing for bass around the GTA or on some beach playing volleyball. If you would like to get in touch, please email me at leo.haung4977@gmail.com .
